                <h3>Will masks be required at the wedding?</h3>
                <p>
                  We are asking guests to wear masks at the wedding when social distancing is not possible. Of course, masks are not
                  required when eating and drinking. We will have extra masks on hand for people who forget to bring them or need a
                  replacement during the event.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What social distancing measures will be in place?</h3>
                <p>
                  We will seat guests with members of their household during the ceremony and reception. There will be extra seats and space
                  between guests of different households. Also, there will be two bars to keep long lines from forming. There are 2
                  entrances and exits to avoid bottlenecks when entering and exiting the venue. Right when you arrive, instead of waiting in
                  the foyer, you will be able to go inside the ceremony space and find a seat.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h3>How many people will be there?</h3>
                <p>
                  <b>Updated 8/26/2020 -- </b>
                  We are inviting 128 people. On average, it’s expected that 75% of wedding guests RSVP “yes”, which would be 96.
                  <b>However, due to current health circumstances, we’re expecting around 50%, which would be about 64 people.</b> As of
                  July 1, Virginia allows events of up to 250 people.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What’s the venue’s capacity?</h3>
                <p>
                  Our venue holds 225 people, so we’re expecting well under 50% capacity. It has high ceilings and good ventilation inside,
                  as well as a small covered outdoor area where guests can smoke and drink outside. Weather permitting, guests will also be
                  able to hang outside in other areas around the venue, as long as they don’t have open alcohol containers.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  What sanitization and cleaning products will be available?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  There will be a sanitizing station in the ceremony and reception space, as well as personal hand sanitizers provided to
                  each guest. There will be multiple hand sanitizer bottles placed around the venue for guest use. The kitchen also has a
                  sanitizing station for the staff.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What’s the bathroom situation?</h3>
                <p>
                  The bathrooms will be cleaned multiple times every hour, and there will be sanitizer inside each bathroom. Guests are
                  encouraged to dry their hands with paper towels instead of air dryers to prevent the spread of germs. Masks are required
                  in the bathrooms.

                <h3>Will the catering staff be screened prior to the event?</h3>
                <p>
                  Each member of the catering staff will be tested for coronavirus prior to our event. They will also participate in daily
                  health and temperature screenings, including the morning of our wedding.
                </p>
              </li>

                <h3>What is a served buffet, and is it safe?</h3>
                <p>
                  Our catering manager reassured us that a served buffet will be safer than a plated dinner because there will be fewer
                  people coming into contact with the food. There will be a very limited amount of people allowed at the buffet area at a
                  time, and it is not self-serve. The servers will be wearing masks and gloves, and they will place the food on plates for
                  each guest, depending on what each guest chooses. Guests will be required to wear masks within 6 feet of the buffet line.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>What kind of dishes and cutlery will be provided?</h3>
                <p>
                  There will be “high end disposable” plates, cups, cutlery, etc.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>How will dessert be served?</h3>
                <p>
                  There will be a dessert table with individually wrapped desserts to choose from. Guests will be required to wear masks
                  within 6 feet of the dessert table.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>How will drinks be served?</h3>
                <p>
                  Bottled water will be provided to each guest, instead of a water station. Iced tea, beer, and wine will be available at
                  the bar. Every drink will be in an individual container. The bartenders will be wearing masks and gloves. Guests will be
                  required to wear masks within 6 feet of the bar.
                </p>

                <h3>Will there be dancing?</h3>
                <p>
                  <b>Updated 8/26/2020 -- </b>
                  <b>
                    After dinner, we are planning on playing trivia, complete with drinks, desserts, and dope prizes! After trivia, we are
                    looking into the possibility of some kind of dancing, albeit a shortended time frame. Masks and distancing measures will
                    be in place, so stay for this part of the evening only if you feel comfortable.

                  What if CDC or Virginia Department of Health guidelines change by September 26?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We will stay up-to-date on CDC and Virginia guidelines, and we will update this page as new information becomes available.
                  All of our vendors have assured us that they are complying with CDC and Virginia guidelines.
